## Capability Domain: Provider

The Provider capability domain encompasses three related areas; Provider Enrollment, Provider Management, and Provider Termination. 

## Capability Area: Provider Enrollment

Provider Enrollment encompasses the processes and systems used to register healthcare providers in the Medicaid program, including application processing, screening, verification, and enrollment decisions. This capability area aligns with CMS-Required outcomes PM1 (Application), PM2-3 (Screening), PM4 (Revalidation), PM6 (Reactivation), PM8-13 (Site Visits, Background Checks, External Systems Checks, Risk Level Assignment, Application Fees, Moratoria).

## Outcomes

### Description
The Outcomes dimension focuses on the results and effectiveness of the provider enrollment process.

### Maturity Level Assessment

#### Level 1: Initial
Manual provider enrollment process with paper-based applications and limited validation of provider information. No systematic approach to screening against federal databases or tracking revalidation requirements.

#### Level 2: Repeatable
Basic online enrollment forms with some automated validation, though manual review is still required for most applications. Basic screening against required databases (LEIE, EPLS, NPPES, Death Master File) with manual tracking of revalidation cycles.

#### Level 3: Defined
Fully electronic enrollment process with automated validation against multiple sources and self-service status checking. Automated screening against all required federal databases with systematic tracking of the five-year revalidation cycle. Risk-based screening protocols implemented according to federal requirements.

#### Level 4: Managed
Intelligent workflow with predictive analytics, real-time credential verification, and automated risk assessment. Proactive management of revalidation cycles with automated notifications and tracking. Advanced risk-based screening with automated adjustment of provider risk levels based on program integrity factors.

#### Level 5: Optimized
Continuous monitoring and revalidation with cross-program enrollment coordination and adaptive enrollment requirements based on provider risk. Real-time monitoring of provider status changes across federal and state databases with automated alerts for potential issues. Dynamic risk assessment that adapts to emerging program integrity concerns.

## Roles

### Description
The Roles dimension addresses the responsibilities and interactions of staff and providers in the enrollment process.

### Maturity Level Assessment

#### Level 1: Initial
Provider enrollment specialists manually process applications with limited provider self-service capabilities and siloed responsibilities across enrollment steps.

#### Level 2: Repeatable
Providers can submit applications online, staff roles are focused on specific verification tasks, with limited coordination between enrollment teams.

#### Level 3: Defined
Provider self-service for most enrollment functions, specialized staff handle exceptions and complex cases, with coordinated roles across enrollment workflow.

#### Level 4: Managed
Automated assignment of tasks based on expertise, cross-trained staff with decision support tools, and collaborative enrollment teams.

#### Level 5: Optimized
Dynamic role assignment based on enrollment complexity, continuous learning systems support staff decisions, with seamless coordination across programs and agencies.

## Business Processes

### Description
The Business Processes dimension covers the workflows, procedures, and operational aspects of provider enrollment.

### Maturity Level Assessment

#### Level 1: Initial
Manual, paper-based workflow with sequential processing steps and limited tracking of application status.

#### Level 2: Repeatable
Basic electronic workflow with some automated validations, though manual intervention is required for most steps.

#### Level 3: Defined
Fully electronic workflow with parallel processing where possible and automated tracking and notifications.

#### Level 4: Managed
Intelligent workflow with adaptive routing, automated exception handling, and predictive workload management.

#### Level 5: Optimized
Continuous process optimization with cross-program enrollment coordination and real-time adaptation to regulatory changes.

## Information

### Description
The Information dimension addresses the data, data models, and information management aspects of provider enrollment.

### Maturity Level Assessment

#### Level 1: Initial
Basic provider demographic information with manual verification of credentials and limited data sharing between systems.

#### Level 2: Repeatable
Structured provider data model with electronic storage of supporting documentation and basic interfaces with external verification sources.

#### Level 3: Defined
Comprehensive provider data model with automated data validation rules and integration with multiple verification sources.

#### Level 4: Managed
Enhanced data model supporting advanced analytics, real-time data validation and enrichment, and comprehensive provider risk profile.

#### Level 5: Optimized
Dynamic data model adapting to changing requirements, continuous data quality monitoring, and seamless information sharing across programs.

## Technology

### Description
The Technology dimension covers the systems, infrastructure, and technical capabilities supporting provider enrollment.

### Maturity Level Assessment

#### Level 1: Initial
Legacy systems with limited integration, manual data entry and verification, and minimal automation.

#### Level 2: Repeatable
Basic web forms for provider enrollment, document management system, and limited system integration.

#### Level 3: Defined
Integrated provider enrollment system, automated workflow management, and API-based integration with verification sources.

#### Level 4: Managed
Cloud-based enrollment platform, advanced analytics and decision support, and comprehensive API ecosystem.

#### Level 5: Optimized
Microservices architecture, AI/ML-powered enrollment processing, and real-time integration with federal and state systems.
